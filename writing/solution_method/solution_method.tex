The solution takes of with how to perform the blocking of the matrix $A$. In
standard linear algebra algorithms (BLAS for example) column major storage of
matrices is assumed. This is usually fine, but since the problem is of block
type this will lead to the blocks themselves not being sequentially stored in
memory which might cause cache misses and false sharing when employing the block
algorithm.
